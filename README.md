## What's new / Important changes

- Clerk authentication: the sign-in page is implemented as a catch-all route at `app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` to satisfy Clerk's requirements for the `SignIn` component.
- Middleware: `middleware.ts` now uses Clerk's server middleware and explicitly allows public routes (e.g., `/`, `/sign-in(.*)` and webhook endpoints). This prevents protected middleware from blocking authentication pages.
- Client-side search & filters: `components/SearchInput.tsx` and `components/SubjectFilters.tsx` update the URL query parameters (topic & subject) and push navigation using `next/navigation`'s `router.push(..., { scroll: false })`. Both components initialize their local state from `useSearchParams()` so the UI stays in sync with the URL.
- Companion routing fix: `components/CompanionCard.tsx` links to `/companions/[id]` (dynamic route). Ensure `app/companions/[id]/page.tsx` exists to render companion sessions.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Add environment variables (create `.env.local`):

```bash
# Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret

# Add any other keys your app depends on (Stripe, etc.)
```

3. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Key Files & Behavior

- `app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` ‚Äî Clerk `SignIn` mounted in a catch-all route. This prevents routing errors Clerk warns about when the component is mounted in a non-catch-all.
- `middleware.ts` ‚Äî Uses Clerk server middleware; `publicRoutes` allow access to sign-in and webhook endpoints. The matcher is configured to avoid Next static assets.
- `components/SearchInput.tsx` ‚Äî Client component that:
  - Reads `topic` from URL via `useSearchParams()`
  - Keeps local input state in sync with URL
  - Pushes URL updates with a debounce (so typing doesn't flood history)
  - Removes the `topic` query param when the input is cleared
- `components/SubjectFilters.tsx` ‚Äî Similar behavior for `subject` query key; updates the URL when selection changes. Uses `Select` from local UI primitives.
- `components/CompanionCard.tsx` ‚Äî Links to `/companions/${id}`; ensure dynamic page exists to avoid 404s.
- `app/companions/page.tsx` ‚Äî Server component that:
  - Uses `authGuard()` (server-side) to protect the route
  - Reads `searchParams` for `subject` and `topic` and calls `getAllCompanions({ subject, topic })` to fetch filtered results

---

## Routing and Auth Notes

- The app uses Clerk for auth; server-side `authGuard()` redirects unauthenticated users to `/sign-in`.
- The sign-in route is public and mounted at a catch-all to support Clerk's `SignIn` component.
- Middleware excludes `_next/static`/images and `favicon.ico` from matching so static assets aren't processed by the middleware.

## Dev Notes and Troubleshooting

- If clicking a companion's `Launch Lesson` results in 404, confirm `app/companions/[id]/page.tsx` exists and the Link is `href={`/companions/${id}`}`.
- If Clerk SignIn throws errors about routing, confirm the catch-all `[[...sign-in]]` route exists and middleware allows `/sign-in(.*)`.
- If client-side filtering/searching doesn't refresh results:
  - Ensure `app/companions/page.tsx` reads `searchParams` and forwards `subject` and `topic` into the data fetch used by the Server Component. Example:

```ts
const subject = searchParams.subject || '';
const topic = searchParams.topic || '';
const companions = await getAllCompanions({ subject, topic });
```

- Tailwind: if styling on UI primitives isn't applied, confirm `tailwind.config.js` includes `app/**/*` and `components/**/*` in `content`.
